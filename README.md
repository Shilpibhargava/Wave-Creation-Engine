# Python Dash App -- Wave Creation Engine 

This application is a replacement for DWC (Distribution Wave Creation Engine) used by UDC's control center teams to analyse daily drops and makes waves out of it. The above tool creates waves automatically (for PTS) based on box dimensions and space taken by boxes in the PTS aisles and giving lots of features for user to choose from.
